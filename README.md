### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
An Artificial Neural Network is a basic deep learning model inspired by the human brain. It consists of input, hidden, and output layers and is used for tasks like classification and prediction.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A Convolutional Neural Network is a specialized neural network mainly used for image and spatial data. It automatically learns features such as edges, textures, and shapes using convolution filters.

### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
A Recurrent Neural Network is designed for sequential data. It has feedback connections that allow it to remember previous information, making it suitable for text, speech, and time-series data.
